# SMS Spam Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

üì© A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project to classify SMS messages as either **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using machine learning models.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to build a text classification system that can automatically detect whether an incoming SMS message is **spam** or **ham**.  
We preprocess text data using NLP techniques and train a machine learning model to perform binary classification.

The project showcases the power of combining text preprocessing with ML algorithms for real-world spam detection tasks.

## üìö Libraries and Frameworks

- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

- **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- The dataset contains SMS labeled as:
  - **ham**: Normal (non-spam) messages
  - **spam**: Unwanted promotional messages

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
Run the Notebook:

Open sms_spam_detection.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Download necessary NLTK corpora (stopwords, punkt).

Run all cells sequentially.

Training and Evaluation:

Preprocess the text: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).

Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

üìä Results

Metric	Value (Example)
Accuracy	97%
Precision	96%
Recall	95%
F1 Score	95.5%
(Replace with your actual results.)

üéØ Features

üèÜ Future Work
Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for better performance.

Build a web-based SMS spam detection app.

Experiment with more feature engineering techniques.

Handle multi-lingual SMS spam detection.
